    The project includes state-of-the-art facilities designed for
    recreation and improving learning outcomes. Ribat aims to build a
    well-rounded society for the next generation. The dream of (late)
    Hafiz Muhammed Ismail &amp; (late) Hafiz Muhammed Ibrahim came to
    reality with the construction of The Campus and its facilities; it
    is a safe, healthy, and academically fruitful place for every
    individual.

          At md+ this column collapses to 0 height (its content is pulled
          out of flow with md:absolute), so items-center on the row places
          this 0px box exactly at the row's vertical midpoint. The image
          inside is then centered on that same midpoint, which makes it
          overflow the row symmetrically top and bottom.
